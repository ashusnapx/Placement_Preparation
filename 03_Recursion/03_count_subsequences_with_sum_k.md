This code calculates the number of subsequences of an array that sum up to a given `final_sum`.

- `count_subsequences` is a recursive function that takes parameters:
  - `index`: the current index of the array being considered.
  - `initial_sum`: the sum of elements included so far.
  - `final_sum`: the target sum that the subsequences should achieve.
  - `arr`: the array containing the elements.
  - `size_of_array`: the size of the array.

- At the beginning of the function, there is a check to see if all elements in the array are positive and the initial sum is already greater than the final sum. If this condition is met, it returns 0, indicating that there are no valid subsequences.

- The function then checks for the base case. If the `index` reaches the `size_of_array`, it means we have considered all elements. At this point, the function checks if the `initial_sum` is equal to the `final_sum`. If they are equal, it returns 1, indicating that a valid subsequence has been found. Otherwise, it returns 0.

- In the recursive step, the function considers two cases: including the current element (`arr[index]`) in the subsequence and excluding it.

- When including the current element, it adds `arr[index]` to the `initial_sum` and makes a recursive call with the updated `initial_sum`. The result of this call is stored in `l`.

- After the recursive call, the code subtracts `arr[index]` from the `initial_sum` to revert back to the previous state.

- Then, it makes another recursive call without including the current element. The result of this call is stored in `r`.

- Finally, the function returns the sum of `l` and `r`, which represents the count of valid subsequences found in both cases.

- In the `main` function, a sample input is provided, and the `count_subsequences` function is called with the initial values for `index

` and `initial_sum` set to 0. The result is printed to the console.
