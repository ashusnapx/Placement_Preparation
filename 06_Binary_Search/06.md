# Code Explanation

## Code Overview
The provided code is written in C++ and aims to find the first and last occurrence of a given value in a given array. It provides two different approaches to solve the problem: a brute-force approach and an approach utilizing the C++ Standard Template Library (STL). Additionally, the code includes helper functions `first_using_plain_binary`, `last_using_plain_binary`, and `count` to further enhance the functionality.

## Function: `first_and_last_brute`
The `first_and_last_brute` function takes an input array, its size, and a value as parameters. It iterates through the array using a for loop and checks each element to find the first and last occurrences of the given value. It maintains two variables, `first` and `last`, initially set to -1. Whenever the value is found, it updates `first` and `last` accordingly.

## Function: `first_and_last_using_STL`
The `first_and_last_using_STL` function also takes an input array, its size, and a value as parameters. It uses two STL functions: `lower_bound` and `upper_bound`. `lower_bound` returns an iterator pointing to the first element not less than the given value, while `upper_bound` returns an iterator pointing to the first element greater than the given value. By subtracting the array's beginning iterator from the `lower_bound` and `upper_bound` iterators, the indices of the first and last occurrences are obtained. If the `lower_bound` index is equal to the array size or the value at that index is not equal to the given value, the function returns {-1, -1} to indicate that the value is not present in the array.

## Function: `first_using_plain_binary` and `last_using_plain_binary`
The `first_using_plain_binary` and `last_using_plain_binary` functions use a binary search approach to find the first and last occurrences of the given value in a sorted array. They initialize `first` and `last` variables to -1 and maintain a low and high index to represent the search range. The binary search is performed by repeatedly calculating the midpoint between the low and high indices and comparing the value at the midpoint with the target value. If the midpoint value matches the target value, the `first` or `last` variable is updated accordingly, and the search range is adjusted accordingly. If the midpoint value is less than the target value, the low index is updated, and if the midpoint value is greater, the high index is updated. The binary search continues until the low index exceeds the high index, indicating that the search range has been exhausted.

## Function: `count`
The `count` function takes an input array, its size, and a value as parameters. It utilizes the `first_using_plain_binary` and `last_using_plain_binary` functions to find the first and last occurrences of the value in the array. If either the `first` or `last` index is -1 or the `first` index is greater than the `last` index, it means the value is not present, and the function returns 0. Otherwise, it returns the count of occurrences by subtracting the `first` index from the `last` index and adding 1.

## Main Function
The main function demonstrates the usage of the implemented functions. It creates an input array, sets a value to search for, and obtains the array size. It then calls the `first_and_last_brute` and `first_and_last_using_STL` functions to find the first and last occurrences of the value using both approaches. The results are printed along with the count of occurrences.

# Complexity Analysis

## Time Complexity
- `first_and_last_brute`: The

 function iterates through the array once, resulting in a time complexity of O(N), where N is the size of the array.
- `first_and_last_using_STL`: The `lower_bound` and `upper_bound` functions both have a time complexity of O(log N), where N is the size of the array. Therefore, this function also has a time complexity of O(log N).
- `first_using_plain_binary` and `last_using_plain_binary`: Both functions perform binary search on the sorted array, resulting in a time complexity of O(log N), where N is the size of the array.
- `count`: This function calls `first_using_plain_binary` and `last_using_plain_binary`, which have a time complexity of O(log N), resulting in a total time complexity of O(log N).

## Space Complexity
- `first_and_last_brute`, `first_and_last_using_STL`, `first_using_plain_binary`, `last_using_plain_binary`: These functions do not utilize any extra space apart from the input array and a few variables. Therefore, their space complexity is O(1).
- `count`: This function uses a constant amount of space, so its space complexity is also O(1).

# Example
Let's consider the example from the provided code:

```cpp
vector<int> arr = {1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 5, 6, 6, 6};
int value = 6;
int arr_size = arr.size();
```

### `first_and_last_brute`
The `first_and_last_brute` function will iterate through the array and find the first occurrence of the value as index 7 and the last occurrence as index 9. The function will return `make_pair(7, 9)`.

### `first_and_last_using_STL`
The `first_and_last_using_STL` function will use `lower_bound` and `upper_bound` to find the first and last occurrences. The `lower_bound` will return the index 7, and the `upper_bound` will return the index 10. Subtracting the beginning iterator gives the indices 7 and 9. The function will return `make_pair(7, 9)`.

### `count`
The `count` function calls `first_using_plain_binary` and `last_using_plain_binary` functions to find the first and last occurrences. The `first_using_plain_binary` will return index 7, and `last_using_plain_binary` will return index 9. Since both indices are valid and the first index is less than or equal to the last index, the function will return `9 - 7 + 1 = 3`, indicating that the value 6 appears three times in the array.

The output of the provided code will be:

```
First occurrence: 7
Last occurrence: 9
Number of occurrences: 3

First occurrence(using STL): 7
Last occurrence(using STL): 9
Number of occurrences: 3
```

This indicates that the code correctly finds the first and last occurrences of the value 6 in the given array and counts the total number of occurrences as 3.
