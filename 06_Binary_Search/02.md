## README

This code implements the `searchInsert` function to find the index at which a target value should be inserted into a sorted array. It utilizes the `lower_bound` function from the standard library (`bits/stdc++.h`) to perform the search operation efficiently.

### Code Explanation

The code is written in C++ and includes the necessary header file `bits/stdc++.h` for convenience, which includes commonly used standard library headers.

The code consists of two functions:
1. `searchInsert`: This function performs the search and insert operation on a sorted array.
2. `main`: This function serves as the entry point of the program.

#### searchInsert Function

The `searchInsert` function takes two arguments: a reference to a vector of integers (`arr`) and an integer value to search and insert (`m`). The function returns the index at which the target value should be inserted into the sorted array.

The function utilizes the `lower_bound` function from the standard library, which returns an iterator pointing to the first element that is not less than the target value (`m`). To obtain the index, the difference between the returned iterator and the beginning iterator of the array is calculated using the `std::vector::begin` function.

#### main Function

The `main` function is the entry point of the program. In the provided code, the `main` function is empty and does not contain any executable statements. You can add the necessary code inside the `main` function to test the `searchInsert` function.

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of the `searchInsert` function depends on the underlying implementation of the `lower_bound` function, which typically has a time complexity of O(log n) for a sorted range of size n. Thus, the time complexity of the `searchInsert` function is also O(log n).

### Space Complexity

The space complexity of the `searchInsert` function is O(1) as it does not require any additional space that scales with the input size. It only uses a constant amount of space to store and manipulate the indices.

### Example

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <bits/stdc++.h>

int searchInsert(vector<int>& arr, int m)
{
    return lower_bound(arr.begin(), arr.end(), m) - arr.begin();
}

int main()
{
    vector<int> arr = {1, 3, 5, 6};
    int target = 4;
    int index = searchInsert(arr, target);
    cout << "Target should be inserted at index: " << index << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

Output:
```
Target should be inserted at index: 2
```

In this example, the `searchInsert` function is used to find the index at which the target value 4 should be inserted into the sorted array [1, 3, 5, 6]. The expected output is 2 since the target value should be inserted at index 2 to maintain the sorted order.

### Summary

The provided code demonstrates the usage of the `searchInsert` function to find the index at which a target value should be inserted into a sorted array. It utilizes the `lower_bound` function to perform an efficient binary search. The code has a time complexity of O(log n) and a space complexity of O(1). It can be used to efficiently determine the insertion point of a value in a sorted array.
