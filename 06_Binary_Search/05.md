## Code Explanation

The given code finds the first and last occurrences of a given value in a vector of integers using a brute-force approach. Let's go through the code step by step:

1. The necessary header files, `iostream` and `vector`, are included.

2. The function `first_and_last_brute` is defined, which takes a reference to a vector `arr`, the size of the array `arr_size`, and the value to be searched `value` as parameters.

3. Two variables, `first` and `last`, are initialized to -1. These variables will store the indices of the first and last occurrences of the given value.

4. A loop is used to iterate over the elements of the array `arr`. The loop variable `i` represents the current index.

5. Inside the loop, an if statement checks if the current element `arr[i]` is equal to the given value. If it is, the following actions are performed:
   - If `first` is still -1 (indicating that the first occurrence has not been found yet), the current index `i` is assigned to `first`.
   - The current index `i` is always assigned to `last`, updating it with each occurrence of the value.

6. After the loop finishes, a pair of integers is created using the `make_pair` function, with `first` as the first element and `last` as the second element.

7. The pair of indices is returned as the result of the function.

8. In the `main` function:
   - A test vector `arr` is created with some sample values.
   - The value to be searched is set to `value`.
   - The size of the array is stored in `arr_size`.
   - The `first_and_last_brute` function is called, passing the vector `arr`, `arr_size`, and `value` as arguments.
   - The returned pair of indices is stored in the `result` variable.
   - The first and last occurrences are printed using `cout`.

## Complexity Analysis

The time complexity of the `first_and_last_brute` function is O(n) because it iterates through the entire array in the worst case, where n is the size of the array.

The space complexity is O(1) because only a constant amount of additional space is used to store the indices.

## Example

Let's consider the example provided in the code:

```cpp
vector<int> arr = {1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 3, 6, 7};
int value = 3;
```

The array `arr` contains integers, and we want to find the first and last occurrences of the value 3.

- First, the `first` and `last` variables are initialized to -1.

- The loop iterates through the array. When `i = 2`, the value 3 is found, and since `first` is still -1, it is updated to 2. `last` is also updated to 2.

- The loop continues, and when `i = 3`, another occurrence of 3 is found. This time, `first` is not -1, so it remains unchanged, and `last` is updated to 3.

- The loop continues until the end of the array.

- Finally, the pair of indices (2, 3) is returned as the result.

The output will be:

```
First occurrence: 2
Last occurrence: 3
```

This means that the first occurrence of 3 is at index 2, and the last occurrence is at index 3 in the given array.

Note: The code

 assumes that the input array is sorted. If the array is unsorted, the results may not be accurate.


The code you provided is an improved version of the previous code, handling the case when the value is not found in the array. Here's the explanation of the code:

```cpp
pair<int, int> first_and_last_using_STL(vector<int>& arr, int arr_size, int value)
{
    int first = lower_bound(arr.begin(), arr.end(), value) - arr.begin();

    // Check if the value is not found in the array
    if (first == arr_size || arr[first] != value)
    {
        // Return {-1, -1} to indicate that the value is not present
        return {-1, -1};
    }

    // Calculate the last occurrence index
    int last = upper_bound(arr.begin(), arr.end(), value) - arr.begin() - 1;

    // Return the pair of indices
    return make_pair(first, last);
}
```

Explanation:
1. The function `first_and_last_using_STL` takes a reference to a vector `arr`, the size of the array `arr_size`, and the value to be searched `value` as parameters.

2. The lower bound of the value is calculated using `lower_bound(arr.begin(), arr.end(), value)`. This returns an iterator pointing to the first element that is not less than `value`. Subtracting `arr.begin()` gives the index of the lower bound.

3. The code then checks if the lower bound index is equal to `arr_size` or if the element at that index is not equal to the value. This condition indicates that the value is not found in the array. In this case, the function returns `{-1, -1}` to indicate that the value is not present.

4. If the value is found in the array, the code proceeds to calculate the last occurrence index. It uses `upper_bound(arr.begin(), arr.end(), value)` to find an iterator pointing to the first element that is greater than `value`. Subtracting `arr.begin()` gives the index of the upper bound. To get the index of the last occurrence, we subtract 1 from the upper bound index.

5. Finally, a pair of indices is created using `make_pair(first, last)` and returned as the result.

The code has been optimized to handle the case when the value is not found, returning {-1, -1}. It uses the standard library functions `lower_bound` and `upper_bound` to efficiently find the indices. The time complexity of the code is O(log n) due to the use of binary search in `lower_bound` and `upper_bound`, where n is the size of the array. The space complexity is O(1) as no additional space is used.

The code you provided consists of two functions: `first_using_plain_binary` and `last_using_plain_binary`. These functions use plain binary search to find the first and last occurrences of a given value in a sorted array. Here's the explanation of the code:

```cpp
int first_using_plain_binary(vector<int>& arr, int arr_size, int value)
{
    int first = -1;
    int low = 0, high = arr_size - 1;

    while (low <= high)
    {
        int mid = (low + high) / 2;

        if (arr[mid] == value)
        {
            first = mid;
            high = mid - 1;
        }
        else if (arr[mid] < value)
        {
            low = mid + 1;
        }
        else
        {
            high = mid - 1;
        }
    }

    return first;
}
```

Explanation of `first_using_plain_binary`:
1. The function `first_using_plain_binary` takes a reference to a vector `arr`, the size of the array `arr_size`, and the value to be searched `value` as parameters.

2. The variable `first` is initialized to -1, which will be updated with the index of the first occurrence of the value.

3. Two variables `low` and `high` are initialized to represent the range of indices to search within the array. `low` starts at the beginning (0) and `high` starts at the end (`arr_size - 1`).

4. Inside the while loop, the middle index `mid` is calculated as the average of `low` and `high`.

5. If the element at index `mid` is equal to the value, it means we have found a potential occurrence of the value. We update `first` with the current `mid` index and then narrow down the search to the left side by setting `high = mid - 1`.

6. If the element at index `mid` is less than the value, it means the value must be present in the right half of the array. We update `low` to `mid + 1` to search in the right half.

7. If the element at index `mid` is greater than the value, it means the value must be present in the left half of the array. We update `high` to `mid - 1` to search in the left half.

8. The while loop continues until `low` is greater than `high`, which indicates that the search range has been exhausted.

9. Finally, the function returns the value of `first`, which will be the index of the first occurrence of the value in the array.

The `last_using_plain_binary` function follows the same logic as `first_using_plain_binary`, but it searches for the last occurrence of the value by updating `last` and narrowing down the search to the right side of the array.

The time complexity of both functions is O(log n), where n is the size of the array. The space complexity is O(1) as no additional space is used.

Here's an example usage of the functions:

```cpp
vector<int> arr = {1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 3, 6, 7};
int value = 3;
int arr_size = arr.size();

int firstOccurrence = first_using_plain_binary(arr, arr_size, value);
int lastOccurrence = last_using_plain_binary(arr, arr_size, value);

cout << "First occurrence: " << firstOccurrence << endl;
cout << "Last occurrence: " << lastOccurrence << endl;
```

Output:
```
First occurrence: 

2
Last occurrence: 6
```

In this example, the array is [1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 3, 6, 7]. The value to search for is 3. The `first_using_plain_binary` function returns the index of the first occurrence of 3, which is 2. The `last_using_plain_binary` function returns the index of the last occurrence of 3, which is 6.
