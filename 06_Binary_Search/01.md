## README

This code implements the upper bound algorithm without using the standard library (STL) upper_bound function. The algorithm finds the smallest index in a sorted array where the element at that index is strictly greater than a given target value. The code utilizes binary search to achieve an efficient solution.

### Code Explanation

The code is written in C++ and does not require any additional header files apart from the `bits/stdc++.h` file, which includes commonly used standard library headers.

The code consists of two functions:
1. `upper_bound_without_stl`: This function performs the upper bound search on a sorted array.
2. `main`: This function demonstrates the usage of `upper_bound_without_stl` and compares its result with the upper_bound function provided by the STL.

#### upper_bound_without_stl Function

The `upper_bound_without_stl` function takes three arguments: a pointer to an integer array (`arr`), the size of the array (`arr_size`), and the target value to search for (`target`). The function returns the smallest index in the array where the element is strictly greater than the target value.

The function initializes three variables:
- `low`: Represents the lowest index of the search range, initially set to 0.
- `high`: Represents the highest index of the search range, initially set to `arr_size - 1`.
- `ans`: Represents the current best answer (smallest index) found so far, initially set to `arr_size`.

The function then enters a binary search loop using the variables `low` and `high`. While `low` is less than or equal to `high`, the loop continues.

Inside the loop, the midpoint of the search range is calculated using `(high + low) / 2` and stored in the variable `mid`.

The function checks if the element at `arr[mid]` is strictly greater than the target value. If true, it updates `ans` with the current `mid` value and narrows the search range by updating `high` to `mid - 1`. This is because we are looking for the smallest index where the element is strictly greater than the target.

If the element at `arr[mid]` is less than or equal to the target value, the search range is updated by setting `low` to `mid + 1`.

Once the binary search loop concludes, the function returns the value stored in `ans`, representing the smallest index where the element is strictly greater than the target value.

#### main Function

The `main` function demonstrates the usage of the `upper_bound_without_stl` function. It initializes an array `arr` with sorted values and assigns its size to `n`.

The function then calls `upper_bound_without_stl` with the `arr` array, `n` size, and a target value of 9. The result is printed as the upper bound obtained using the custom implementation.

To provide a comparison, the code also uses the upper_bound function from the STL by passing the array `arr`, `arr + 10` as the range, and subtracting the array `arr` to get the index. The result is printed as the upper bound obtained using the STL function.

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this code is O(log base 2 n), where n is the size of the array. The `upper_bound_without_stl` function performs a binary search, reducing the search range by half at each iteration.

### Space Complexity

The space complexity of this code is O(1) as it only uses a few variables to perform the binary search. No additional data structures are used.

### Example

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    int arr

[] = { 1 , 2 , 3 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 8 , 10 , 10 , 11 };
    int n = 10;
    cout << "Upper bound = " << upper_bound_without_stl(arr, n, 9) << endl;
    cout << "Upper bound (using STL) = " << upper_bound(arr, arr + 10, 9) - arr << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

Output:
```
Upper bound = 7
Upper bound (using STL) = 7
```

This example demonstrates the usage of the `upper_bound_without_stl` function on the given array `arr`. The expected output is the index 7, which represents the smallest index where the element is strictly greater than the target value of 9. The output is consistent with the result obtained using the STL upper_bound function.

### Summary

The provided code implements the upper bound algorithm without using the STL upper_bound function. It performs a binary search to find the smallest index where the element is strictly greater than the target value. The code has a time complexity of O(log base 2 n) and a space complexity of O(1). It can be used as an alternative when the STL is not available or to understand the underlying logic of the upper bound algorithm.
