## README

This code implements the lower bound algorithm without using the standard library (STL) lower_bound function. The algorithm finds the smallest index in a sorted array where the element at that index is greater than or equal to a given target value. The code utilizes binary search to achieve an efficient solution.

### Code Explanation

The code is written in C++ and does not require any additional header files apart from the `bits/stdc++.h` file, which includes commonly used standard library headers.

The code consists of two functions:
1. `lower_bound_without_stl`: This function performs the lower bound search on a sorted array.
2. `main`: This function demonstrates the usage of `lower_bound_without_stl` and compares its result with the lower_bound function provided by the STL.

#### lower_bound_without_stl Function

The `lower_bound_without_stl` function takes three arguments: a pointer to an integer array (`arr`), the size of the array (`arr_size`), and the target value to search for (`target`). The function returns the smallest index in the array where the element is greater than or equal to the target value.

The function initializes three variables:
- `low`: Represents the lowest index of the search range, initially set to 0.
- `high`: Represents the highest index of the search range, initially set to `arr_size - 1`.
- `ans`: Represents the current best answer (smallest index) found so far, initially set to `arr_size`.

The function then enters a binary search loop using the variables `low` and `high`. While `low` is less than or equal to `high`, the loop continues.

Inside the loop, the midpoint of the search range is calculated using `(high + low) / 2` and stored in the variable `mid`.

The function checks if the element at `arr[mid]` is greater than or equal to the target value. If true, it updates `ans` with the current `mid` value and narrows the search range by updating `high` to `mid - 1`. This is because we are looking for the smallest index where the element is greater than or equal to the target.

If the element at `arr[mid]` is less than the target value, the search range is updated by setting `low` to `mid + 1`.

Once the binary search loop concludes, the function returns the value stored in `ans`, representing the smallest index where the element is greater than or equal to the target value.

#### main Function

The `main` function demonstrates the usage of the `lower_bound_without_stl` function. It initializes an array `arr` with sorted values and assigns its size to `n`.

The function then calls `lower_bound_without_stl` with the `arr` array, `n` size, and a target value of 9. The result is printed as the lower bound obtained using the custom implementation.

To provide a comparison, the code also uses the lower_bound function from the STL by passing the array `arr`, `arr + 10` as the range, and subtracting the array `arr` to get the index. The result is printed as the lower bound obtained using the STL function.

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this code is O(log base 2 n), where n is the size of the array. The `lower_bound_without_stl` function performs a binary search, reducing the search range by half at each iteration.

### Space Complexity

The space complexity of this code is O(1) as it only uses a few variables to perform the binary search. No additional data structures are used.

### Example

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;



int main()
{
    int arr[] = { 1, 2, 3, 3, 5, 8, 8, 10, 10, 11 };
    int n = 10;
    cout << "Lower bound = " << lower_bound_without_stl(arr, n, 9) << endl;
    cout << "Lower bound (using STL) = " << lower_bound(arr, arr + 10, 9) - arr << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

Output:
```
Lower bound = 7
Lower bound (using STL) = 7
```

### Code Flow and Variable Initialization

1. The code includes the necessary headers and defines the `lower_bound_without_stl` function.
2. The `lower_bound_without_stl` function is defined, taking a pointer to an integer array (`arr`), the size of the array (`arr_size`), and a target value (`target`) as input.
3. The `lower_bound_without_stl` function initializes the `low`, `high`, and `ans` variables.
4. The function enters a binary search loop.
5. Inside the loop, the midpoint `mid` is calculated.
6. The function checks if `arr[mid]` is greater than or equal to `target`.
7. If true, the `ans` value is updated, and `high` is narrowed.
8. If false, the search range is updated by modifying `low`.
9. Once the binary search loop concludes, the `ans` value is returned.
10. The `main` function is defined.
11. The `arr` array is initialized with sorted values.
12. The size of the array `n` is assigned.
13. The `lower_bound_without_stl` function is called with the `arr` array, `n` size, and a target value of 9. The result is printed.
14. The lower_bound function from the STL is used, and the result is printed.
15. An example usage of the `main` function is provided, where the lower bound is calculated for a target value of 9.
