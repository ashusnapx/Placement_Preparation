## Search in Rotated Sorted Array

📝 This program implements the binary search algorithm to search for a target element in a rotated sorted array.

### Code Explanation

The given code is an implementation of the binary search algorithm to search for a target element in a rotated sorted array.

🔍 The `search_rotated_array` function takes a reference to a vector `arr` and a target element `target` as inputs.

The function initializes two variables, `low` and `high`, representing the lower and upper indices of the array, respectively.

🔁 The while loop continues until `low` is less than or equal to `high`.

In each iteration, it calculates the middle index `mid` as the average of `low` and `high`.

🎯 If the element at index `mid` is equal to the target, it means the target is found, so the function returns `mid`.

If the left half of the array (from `low` to `mid`) is sorted:

✅ It checks if the target lies within the range of elements in the sorted left half.
- If so, it updates `high` to `mid - 1` to search in the left half.
- Otherwise, it updates `low` to `mid + 1` to search in the right half.

If the right half of the array (from `mid` to `high`) is sorted:

✅ It checks if the target lies within the range of elements in the sorted right half.
- If so, it updates `low` to `mid + 1` to search in the right half.
- Otherwise, it updates `high` to `mid - 1` to search in the left half.

If the target is not found in the array, the function returns -1.

💻 In the `main` function, a test case is created with a vector `arr` containing rotated sorted elements.

🎯 The target element `target` is set to 1.

📜 The `search_rotated_array` function is called with `arr` and `target` as arguments, and the returned index is printed.

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of the `search_rotated_array` function is O(log N), where N is the size of the input array. The binary search algorithm reduces the search space by half in each iteration, resulting in a logarithmic time complexity.

### Space Complexity

The space complexity of the code is O(1) since it uses a constant amount of additional space.

### Optimizations

The given code already implements an efficient approach to search for a target element in a rotated sorted array using binary search. There are no further optimizations needed.

### Example

**Input:**
```cpp
vector<int> arr = {5, 6, 7, 1, 2, 3, 4};
int target = 1;
```

**Output:**
```
Index is: 3
```

### Code Snapshots

Here are some code snapshots highlighting important parts of the code:

```cpp
int search_rotated_array(vector<int> &arr, int target)
{
    int low = 0, high = arr.size() - 1;

    while(low <= high)
    {
        int mid = ( low + high ) / 2;

        if(arr[mid] == target)
        {
            return mid;
        }
        // Check if left or right half is sorted
        // Imagining left half is sorted
        else if(arr[low] < arr[mid])
        {
            // Perform binary search in the left half
            // Update low and high accordingly


        }
        // Imagining right half is sorted
        else
        {
            // Perform binary search in the right half
            // Update low and high accordingly
        }
    }

    return -1;
}
```
