## Code Explanation

The given code aims to find the largest number in an array that is less than or equal to a given number. It utilizes binary search to efficiently search for the desired element.

The `floor` function takes three parameters: the array `arr`, the size of the array `arr_size`, and the value to compare `value`. It returns the largest number in the array that is less than or equal to the given value.

Inside the function, an initial value `ans` is set to -1 to handle cases where no element in the array satisfies the condition. Two pointers, `low` and `high`, are initialized to the first and last indices of the array, respectively.

The function then enters a while loop that continues until `low` is less than or equal to `high`. In each iteration, the function calculates the middle index `mid` using the formula `(low + high) / 2`.

If the element at index `mid` is less than or equal to the given value, it updates the `ans` variable with the value at `arr[mid]` and moves the `low` pointer to `mid + 1` to search for a larger element.

If the element at index `mid` is greater than the given value, it moves the `high` pointer to `mid - 1` to search in the lower half of the array.

Finally, when the while loop terminates, the function returns the value of `ans`, which represents the largest number in the array that is less than or equal to the given value.

In the `main` function, an example is provided to demonstrate the usage of the `floor` function. An array `arr` is initialized with elements [5, 10, 15, 20]. The size of the array is 4, and the value to compare is 17. The `floor` function is called with these parameters, and the result is printed.

## Complexity Analysis

The time complexity of the code is O(log n) since binary search is used, where n is the size of the array. In each iteration, the search space is halved, resulting in logarithmic time complexity.

The space complexity is O(1) since the code uses a constant amount of additional space for variables regardless of the size of the input array.

## Optimizations

The given code is already optimized by using binary search, which allows for efficient searching in a sorted array. There are no further optimizations needed for this specific task.

## Example

Let's go through an example with the given array [5, 10, 15, 20] and a value to compare of 17.

1. Initially, the `low` pointer is set to 0 (the first index) and the `high` pointer is set to 3 (the last index).

2. The first iteration of the while loop calculates the middle index as `mid = (low + high) / 2 = (0 + 3) / 2 = 1`. The value at `arr[mid]` is 10, which is less than the given value 17. Thus, the `ans` variable is updated to 10, and the `low` pointer is incremented to `mid + 1 = 2`.

3. In the next iteration, the middle index is recalculated as `mid = (low + high) / 2 = (2 + 3) / 2 = 2`. The value at `arr[mid]` is 15, which is also less than the given value 17. The `ans` variable is updated to 15, and the `low` pointer is incremented to `mid + 1 = 3`.

4. Now, `low

` is equal to `high` (both are 3), and the while loop terminates.

5. The function returns the value of `ans`, which is 15. This is the largest number in the array that is less than or equal to the given value 17.

Therefore, the output of the program will be:
```
15
```

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int floor(int *arr, int arr_size, int value)
{
    int ans = -1;
    int low = 0, high = arr_size - 1;

    while (low <= high)
    {
        int mid = (low + high) / 2;

        if (arr[mid] <= value)
        {
            ans = arr[mid];
            low = mid + 1;
        }
        else
        {
            high = mid - 1;
        }
    }

    return ans;
}

int main()
{
    int arr[] = {5, 10, 15, 20};
    int size = 4;
    int val = 17;

    cout << floor(arr, size, val) << endl;

    return 0;
}
