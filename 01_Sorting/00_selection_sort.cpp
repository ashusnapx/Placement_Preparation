/* so basically in selection sort, the algorithm chooses the minimum or lowest
element from list, then replaces it with the first element. and this goes on.

Step 1 - Find out the minimum from array or vector or list
Step 2 - Swap it with element at first place
Step 3 - Now elements after 0th index are unsorted
Step 4 - Find out the minimum from 1st index to last index
Step 5 - Swap it with element at 1st index
Repeat

TODO: Get the Minimum and Swap it.
