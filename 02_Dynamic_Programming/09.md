# Maze Obstacles Problem

## Recursive Approach

### Explanation
The recursive approach solves the Maze Obstacles problem by finding the number of unique paths from the top-left cell to the bottom-right cell in a maze grid. The helper function recursively explores two possible movements - moving down and moving left. The base cases are defined to handle scenarios such as reaching the destination cell, encountering obstacles, or going out of bounds.

### Flow of Code
1. The `helper` function is called with the current row and column indices and the maze grid.
2. If the current position encounters an obstacle, the function returns 0.
3. If the current position is the destination cell, the function returns 1.
4. If the current position goes out of bounds, the function returns 0.
5. Recursive calls are made for moving down and moving left.
6. The function returns the sum of the results from the recursive calls.

### Variables Meaning
- `row`: Current row index.
- `col`: Current column index.
- `mat`: Maze grid.

     |_________|       |___________|
```

### Intuition
The recursive approach explores all possible paths from the top-left to the bottom-right cell in the maze grid. It sums up the unique paths by considering two movements at each step - moving down and moving left. By recursively exploring these paths, the algorithm calculates the total number of unique paths.

### Time and Space Complexity
The time complexity of the recursive approach is exponential, as it explores all possible paths in the maze. The space complexity is O(m + n), where m and n are the dimensions of the maze grid. This accounts for the recursive call stack.

## Memoization Approach

### Explanation
The memoization approach optimizes the recursive solution by caching previously computed results. It uses a memoization table (`dp`) to store and retrieve the calculated values for each subproblem. This avoids redundant calculations and significantly improves the efficiency of the algorithm.

### Flow of Code
1. The `helper` function is called with the current row and column indices, the maze grid, and the memoization table.
2. If the current position encounters an obstacle or goes out of bounds, the function returns 0.
3. If the current position is the destination cell, the function returns 1.
4. If the value for the current subproblem exists in the memoization table, it is retrieved and returned.
5. Recursive calls are made for moving down and moving left.
6. The calculated result is stored in the memoization table.
7. The function returns the result.

### Variables Meaning
- `row`: Current row index.
- `col`: Current column

 index.
- `mat`: Maze grid.
- `dp`: Memoization table.

                                            Return dp[row][col-1]
```

### Intuition
The memoization approach enhances the efficiency of the recursive solution by storing previously computed results in a memoization table. By caching these results, the algorithm avoids redundant calculations and reduces the time complexity significantly.

### Time and Space Complexity
The time complexity of the memoization approach is O(m * n), where m and n are the dimensions of the maze grid. This is because each cell in the grid is visited exactly once, and the calculated results are stored in the memoization table. The space complexity is also O(m * n) to accommodate the memoization table.

## Tabulation Approach

### Explanation
The tabulation approach solves the Maze Obstacles problem using a dynamic programming technique called tabulation. It iteratively fills in a table (`dp`) from the top-left to the bottom-right, computing the number of unique paths for each subproblem. By using previously computed values, it avoids redundant calculations and efficiently determines the total number of unique paths.

### Flow of Code
1. The `mazeObstacles` function initializes the tabulation table (`dp`) with the base cases.
2. The table is filled iteratively, row by row, starting from the top-left cell.
3. If the current position is the destination cell or encounters an obstacle, the corresponding table value is set accordingly.
4. Otherwise, the table value is calculated by summing up the values from the above and left cells.
5. The final result is retrieved from the bottom-right cell of the table and returned.

### Variables Meaning
- `row`: Number of rows in the maze.
- `col`: Number of columns in the maze.
- `mat`: Maze grid.
- `dp`: Tabulation table.

```

### Intuition
The tabulation approach fills in a table from top to bottom and left to right, iteratively computing the number of unique paths for each subproblem. By using the previously computed values, the algorithm builds up the solution incrementally, ultimately determining the total number of unique paths.

### Time and Space Complexity
The time complexity of the tabulation approach is O(m * n), where m and n are the dimensions of the maze grid. This is because each cell in the grid is visited exactly once to fill in the table. The space complexity is O(m * n) to store the tabulation table.

## Tabulation Approach with Space Optimization

### Explanation
The tabulation approach with space optimization further reduces the space complexity by only storing the required previous row of the table (`prev`) instead of the entire table. It iteratively updates the current row based on the values of the previous row, efficiently calculating the total number of unique paths.

### Flow of Code
1. The `mazeObstacles` function initializes the previous row (`prev`) with the base case values.
2. For each row in the maze grid, a new current row (`curr`) is created.
3. The table values are updated iteratively by considering the values from the above and left cells.
4. The previous row is updated with the current row for the next iteration.
5. The final result is retrieved from the last cell of the previous row and returned.

### Variables Meaning
- `row`: Number of rows in the maze.
- `col`: Number of columns in the maze.
- `mat`: Maze grid.
- `prev`: Previous row values.
- `curr`: Current row values.

### Intuition
The tabulation approach with space optimization uses the concept of rolling arrays to store only the necessary previous row values. By updating the current row based on the values of the previous row, the algorithm efficiently calculates the total number of unique paths while reducing the space complexity.

### Time and Space Complexity
The time complexity of the tabulation approach with space optimization is O(m * n), where m and n are the dimensions of the maze grid. This is because each

 cell in the grid is visited exactly once to update the current row. The space complexity is O(n) to store the previous row and current row values, where n is the number of columns in the maze grid.
