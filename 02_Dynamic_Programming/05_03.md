To compare the three versions of the code in terms of time complexity, space complexity, and optimization, let's analyze each code snippet individually.

### 1st Code:
This code uses a recursive approach to solve the problem. It defines a helper function that takes an index and a vector of numbers. The base case of the recursion is when the index reaches 0, where it returns the number at that index. Otherwise, it calculates the maximum sum by either picking the number at the current index and adding it to the sum obtained by skipping the adjacent number, or by not picking the current number and moving to the next index. It returns the maximum of these two options.

**Time Complexity:** The time complexity of this code is exponential because it explores all possible combinations of picking and not picking the numbers. Each recursive call splits into two recursive calls, resulting in a binary tree-like recursion tree. Therefore, the time complexity is O(2^n), where n is the number of elements in the input vector.

**Space Complexity:** The space complexity of this code is proportional to the depth of the recursion tree, which is equal to n, the number of elements in the input vector. Therefore, the space complexity is O(n).

**Optimization:** The first code does not implement any form of memoization, so it recalculates the same subproblems multiple times. This leads to redundant computations and makes the code inefficient.

### 2nd Code:
This code is an optimized version of the first code. It uses memoization to store the results of subproblems in a separate vector called dp. The dp vector is initialized with -1. In the helper function, before performing any calculations, it checks if the result for the current index is already computed and stored in the dp vector. If so, it returns the stored result. Otherwise, it performs the calculations as in the first code, stores the result in the dp vector, and returns it.

**Time Complexity:** The time complexity of this code is improved due to memoization. The number of unique subproblems is equal to the number of indices in the input vector, which is n. Therefore, the time complexity is O(n).

**Space Complexity:** The space complexity of this code is the same as the first code, i.e., O(n), because it requires the dp vector to store the results of subproblems.

**Optimization:** The second code optimizes the first code by using memoization. It avoids redundant computations by storing and reusing the results of subproblems. This improves the overall efficiency of the code.

### 3rd Code:
This code uses a bottom-up iterative approach to solve the problem. It iterates over the input vector from the second element to the last element. It maintains two variables, `prev` and `prev2`, which represent the maximum sum obtained by picking and not picking the previous element, respectively. For each element, it calculates the maximum sum by either picking the current element and adding it to the sum obtained by not picking the previous element, or by not picking the current element and keeping the sum of the previous element. It updates the `prev` and `prev2` variables accordingly.

**Time Complexity:** The time complexity of this code is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the input vector. It iterates over the vector once, performing constant time operations for each element.

**Space Complexity:** The space complexity of this code is O(1) because it uses a constant amount of additional space to store the `prev` and `prev2` variables.

**Optimization:** The third code further optimizes the second code by eliminating the need for the dp vector and the recursive function. It solves the problem in a single pass through the input vector using only two variables. This makes the

 code more efficient in terms of both time and space.

Overall, the third code is the most optimized among the three as it achieves the same result with better time complexity and lower space complexity.
