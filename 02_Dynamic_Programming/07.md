## Ninja Training - Readme

### Problem Statement
Ninja is planning a training schedule that lasts for 'N' days. Each day, he can perform one of three activities: Running, Fighting Practice, or Learning New Moves. Each activity has a certain number of merit points associated with it. However, Ninja cannot perform the same activity on two consecutive days. The task is to calculate the maximum number of merit points that Ninja can earn given the merit points for each activity on each day.

### Problem Constraints
- 1 <= T <= 10 (number of test cases)
- 1 <= N <= 100000 (number of days)
- 1 <= Values of POINTS array <= 100 (merit points)

### Approach 1: Recursive
The first approach solves the problem using recursion. The `helper` function is used to calculate the maximum merit points for a given day and the last task done. It starts from the last day and tries all possible tasks, excluding the task done on the previous day. The base case is when the current day is 0, and the maximum merit points are calculated for that day. The `ninjaTraining` function invokes the `helper` function to solve the problem by passing the initial parameters.

### Approach 2: Memoization
The second approach improves the efficiency by using memoization. It is similar to the recursive approach but utilizes a memoization table (dp) to store the already computed results. The memoization table avoids redundant calculations by storing and reusing the previously calculated values. The `helper` function checks if the result for a particular state (current day and last task done) is already present in the memoization table before performing the recursive computation.

### Approach 3: Tabulation
The third approach solves the problem using tabulation, which is a bottom-up dynamic programming technique. It uses a 2D DP array to store the maximum merit points for each day and each task. The base cases are initialized for the first day. Then, for each subsequent day, the DP array is filled by considering the maximum points from the previous day's tasks and excluding the task done on the previous day. Finally, the maximum merit points for the last day and any task (represented by index 3 in the DP array) are returned.

### Time and Space Complexity
- Approach 1 (Recursive):
  - Time Complexity: O(3^N) (exponential)
  - Space Complexity: O(N) (recursive stack space)

- Approach 2 (Memoization):
  - Time Complexity: O(N)
  - Space Complexity: O(N)

- Approach 3 (Tabulation):
  - Time Complexity: O(N)
  - Space Complexity: O(N)

### Follow-up
The problem can be extended by introducing additional constraints or variations, such as:
- Adding more activities or types of tasks.
- Modifying the constraint to allow performing the same activity after 'k' consecutive days.
- Finding the sequence of tasks that leads to the maximum merit points.

### Time and Space Optimizations
- Approach 2 (Memoization) optimizes the time complexity by avoiding redundant computations through memoization.
- Approach 3 (Tabulation) optimizes both time and space complexity by eliminating recursion and using a 2D DP array to store the results directly.

### Name of Algorithm Used
The approaches described here do not correspond to any specific well-known algorithms. They are based on dynamic programming techniques to solve the given problem efficiently.

### Base Cases
The base case for the recursive and memoization approaches is when the current day is 0, and the maximum merit points for that day are calculated directly.

### Edge Cases
The code provided handles the constraints specified in the problem statement. The number of test cases, the

 number of days, and the merit points are within the given limits.

### Recursive Call
The recursive approach makes recursive calls to the `helper` function with a reduced current day and the task done on the current day.

### Important Parts
- The recursive approach: The base case where the maximum merit points for the first day are calculated.
- The memoization approach: Checking the memoization table for already computed results before making a recursive call.
- The tabulation approach: Filling the DP array by considering the maximum points from the previous day's tasks and excluding the task done on the previous day.

### Why Only This Approach and Why Not Other Approaches
- The recursive approach is straightforward to understand, but it has exponential time complexity and can lead to redundant computations. It is suitable for small inputs or as a starting point to develop other approaches.
- The memoization approach improves the efficiency by avoiding redundant computations through memoization. It is suitable when the recursive approach is too slow due to repeated calculations.
- The tabulation approach is the most efficient approach as it eliminates recursion and stores the results directly in a 2D DP array. It is suitable for larger inputs and provides the optimal solution.

### Teachings or Learnings from This Question and Code
- Dynamic programming techniques, such as recursion with memoization and tabulation, can be used to solve optimization problems efficiently.
- Memoization can significantly improve the performance of recursive solutions by avoiding redundant computations.
- Tabulation is a powerful technique that allows solving problems iteratively and can be more efficient than recursion.
- Understanding the problem constraints and using appropriate data structures and algorithms can lead to efficient solutions.
