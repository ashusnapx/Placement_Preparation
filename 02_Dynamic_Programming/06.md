## README

This code implements the "House Robber" problem, which aims to determine the maximum amount of money a robber can steal from a row of houses without robbing adjacent houses. The code uses dynamic programming to optimize the solution.

### Code Explanation

The code is written in C++ and uses the `vector` container from the Standard Template Library (STL). The `bits/stdc++.h` header file includes most commonly used standard library headers, reducing the need for including specific headers separately.

The code consists of two functions:
1. `helper`: This function calculates the maximum amount of money that can be stolen from a given row of houses.
2. `houseRobber`: This function determines the maximum amount of money that can be stolen from a row of houses, considering two scenarios: when the first house is included and when the last house is included.

#### Helper Function

The `helper` function takes a reference to a vector of integers (`money`) as input. It uses the following variables:
- `prev2`: Represents the maximum amount of money that can be stolen from the house two positions before the current house.
- `prev`: Represents the maximum amount of money that can be stolen from the house one position before the current house.
- `current_i`: Stores the maximum amount of money that can be stolen from the current house.

The function iterates over the `money` vector starting from the second house (index 1). For each house, it calculates two scenarios:
1. `rob`: Represents the maximum amount of money that can be stolen if the current house is robbed. It adds the value of the current house (`money[i]`) to the maximum amount that can be stolen from two positions before (`prev2`).
2. `notRob`: Represents the maximum amount of money that can be stolen if the current house is not robbed. It considers the maximum amount that can be stolen from the previous house (`prev`).

The function then determines the maximum between `rob` and `notRob` and stores it in `current_i`.

Finally, the values of `prev2`, `prev`, and `current_i` are updated for the next iteration.

The function returns the value stored in `prev`, which represents the maximum amount of money that can be stolen from the entire row of houses.

#### houseRobber Function

The `houseRobber` function takes a reference to a vector of integers (`money`) as input. It handles the case where the size of the `money` vector is 1 separately, as there is only one house available, and the robber can steal all the money from that house.

If the size of `money` is not 1, the function creates two separate vectors, `firstElementExcluded` and `lastElementExcluded`, to handle the scenarios where the first and last houses are excluded, respectively.

The function then calls the `helper` function twice, passing `firstElementExcluded` and `lastElementExcluded` vectors as arguments, and returns the maximum value between the two results.

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this code is O(n), where n is the number of houses. Both the `helper` and `houseRobber` functions iterate over the houses once.

### Space Complexity

The space complexity of this code is O(n), where n is the number of houses. The additional space is used to create `firstElementExcluded` and `lastElementExcluded` vectors, which store the houses with the first and last elements excluded, respectively.

### Example

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    vector<int> money = {2, 7, 9, 3, 1};
    long long int result

 = houseRobber(money);
    cout << "Maximum amount of money that can be stolen: " << result << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

Output:
```
Maximum amount of money that can be stolen: 11
```

### Code Flow and Variable Initialization

1. The code includes the necessary headers and defines the `helper` and `houseRobber` functions.
2. The `helper` function is defined, taking a reference to a vector of integers (`money`) as input.
3. The `helper` function initializes the `prev2`, `prev`, and `current_i` variables.
4. The `helper` function iterates over the `money` vector, starting from the second house.
5. Inside the loop, the `rob` and `notRob` variables are calculated.
6. The maximum value between `rob` and `notRob` is stored in `current_i`.
7. The `prev2`, `prev`, and `current_i` variables are updated for the next iteration.
8. The `prev` value is returned, representing the maximum amount of money that can be stolen.
9. The `houseRobber` function is defined, taking a reference to a vector of integers (`money`) as input.
10. The `houseRobber` function handles the case where `money` vector has only one element and returns the value of that element.
11. If the `money` vector has more than one element, `firstElementExcluded` and `lastElementExcluded` vectors are created.
12. The `helper` function is called twice, passing `firstElementExcluded` and `lastElementExcluded` as arguments.
13. The maximum value between the two results is returned.
14. An example usage of the `houseRobber` function is provided, where a `money` vector is defined, and the maximum amount of money that can be stolen is printed.

That's a detailed explanation of the code, including its implementation, complexity analysis, example usage, and variable initialization.
