# Minimum Path Sum - Readme

## Overview

This repository contains solutions to the "Minimum Path Sum" problem implemented using different approaches. The problem involves finding the minimum sum path in a triangular grid. The following approaches have been implemented:

1. **Recursion**
2. **Memoization**
3. **Tabulation**
4. **Tabulation with Space Optimization**

Each approach is explained in detail below.

## Approach 1: Recursion

**Time complexity**: 2 ^ (sum from 1 to n) [n stands for the number of rows]\
**Space complexity**: O(n)

In this approach, the problem is solved recursively. The helper function `helper()` takes the current row, column, triangular grid, and the number of rows as parameters. It checks if the current row is the last row, in which case it returns the value at that position in the triangular grid. Otherwise, it recursively calculates the minimum path sum by considering the two possible paths (down and diagonal) and returns the minimum of the two.

## Approach 2: Memoization

**Time complexity**: O(n x n) [n stands for the number of rows]\
**Space complexity**: O(n) + O(n x n) [the additional space is used in the dp array]

This approach improves upon the recursive solution by introducing memoization. The `helper()` function is called with an additional `dp` array to store the previously calculated results. Before calculating the minimum path sum for a position, it checks if the result is already memoized. If so, it retrieves the result from the `dp` array; otherwise, it performs the recursive calculations and stores the result in the `dp` array for future use.

## Approach 3: Tabulation

**Time complexity**: O(n x n) [n stands for the number of rows]\
**Space complexity**: O(n x n) [this space is used in the dp array]

This approach utilizes tabulation, where the solution is built iteratively bottom-up. The `minimumPathSum()` function initializes a `dp` array to store the minimum path sum for each position. It starts by copying the last row of the triangular grid into the `dp` array, as it represents the base case. Then, it iterates from the second-to-last row to the first row, calculating the minimum path sum for each position by considering the two possible paths (down and diagonal) and storing the minimum value in the `dp` array. Finally, it returns the minimum path sum from the top of the `dp` array.

## Approach 4: Tabulation with Space Optimization

**Time complexity**: O(n x n) [n stands for the number of rows]\
**Space complexity**: O(n x n) [this space is used in the dp array]

This approach is similar to the previous tabulation approach but optimizes the space usage. Instead of maintaining a 2D `dp` array, it uses two 1D arrays: `frontRow` and `currentRow`. The `frontRow` array represents the previous row of the triangular grid, while the `currentRow` array stores the minimum path sum for the current row. At each iteration, the `frontRow` array is updated with the values from the `currentRow` array, and the `currentRow` array is filled with the minimum path sum values for the current row. This optimization reduces the space complexity to O(n).

## Flowchart

Below is a flowchart depicting the flow of the tabulation approach:

## Variables Meaning

- `t`: Triangular grid representing the input
- `n`: Number of rows in the triangular grid
- `dp`: Dynamic programming array to store the minimum path sum values
- `row`: Current row index
- `col`: Current column index
- `down`: Sum of the current position and the path below it
- `diagonal`: Sum of the current position and the path to the diagonal position

## Base Cases

- In the recursion approach, the base case is when the current row is the last row.
- In the tabulation approach, the base case is when the row index is equal to `n-1`.

## Edge Cases

- The code handles the cases where the input is an empty triangular grid or has only one row.

## Recursive Call

In the recursion and memoization approaches, the `helper()` function is recursively called for the two possible paths: down and diagonal.

## Important Parts

- The recursive calculation of the minimum path sum in the recursion and memoization approaches.
- The iteration and calculation of the minimum path sum in the tabulation and tabulation with space optimization approaches.

## Why This Approach

- The recursive approach is simple to understand but has exponential time complexity due to repeated calculations.
- The memoization approach improves upon the recursive approach by storing the results of subproblems, reducing the time complexity to O(n x n).
- The tabulation approach iteratively builds the solution from the bottom up, eliminating the need for recursion and reducing the time complexity to O(n x n).
- The tabulation with space optimization approach further reduces the space complexity by using two 1D arrays instead of a 2D array, while maintaining the same time complexity.

## Teachings and Learnings

- The importance of understanding the problem structure to choose the appropriate approach.
- The benefits of using dynamic programming techniques like memoization and tabulation to optimize recursive solutions.
- How to iteratively build a solution using tabulation, starting from the base case and gradually calculating the desired solution.
